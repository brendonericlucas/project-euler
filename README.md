Will eventually contain my solutions to Project Euler problems implemented in Python. Please try the problems yourself before looking at others' solutions. It's the only way to learn. Solutions to problems beyond the first 100 will never be public, per the project euler honor code.

Remarks for problem 3: You may find it useful to do a bit of research on sieve methods for generating primes (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

Remarks for problem 5: The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is helpful here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic 

Remarks for problem 6: An efficient solution will make use of formulas for the sum of the first n natrual numbers, and the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

Remarks for problem 7: An efficient solution will use a good upper bound on the kth prime - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem 

Remarks for problem 9: Think about how the given constraints can be used to structure your seach through the solution space. 

Remarks for problem 10: Sometimes, simple is better (and simplest is best)! Start with the most naive approach using nested for-loops, and then think about how you can reduce the number of iterations required overall, and within each nested loop, using facts about how primality and divisibility work. You can flatten the order
of growth significantly by making use of such a strategy.
